Satellite Purpose Prediction
This project leverages a comprehensive satellite database, assembled by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), to predict the purpose of each satellite’s orbit using machine learning models. The UCS database contains details of 6,718 satellites, including their country of origin, purpose, and other operational information. This open-source dataset is a valuable tool for specialists and non-specialists alike.

Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the purpose of satellites based on various attributes in the UCS dataset. By exploring and analyzing this dataset, we aim to build models that can accurately classify the intended use of each satellite.
